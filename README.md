# DSA Archive
A personal archive of classic and advanced Data Structures & Algorithms implemented in Python from FIT3155 Unit.
This repository covers a curated selection of algorithms across string processing, cryptography, compression, and optimization.

## 🔡 String Algorithms
### Z-Algorithm
Efficient linear-time string matching algorithm for computing Z-values.
### Wildcard Pattern Matching using Z-Algorithm
Pattern matching supporting wildcards, leveraging Z-values for efficient processing.
### Ukkonen’s Algorithm for Suffix Tree Construction
Online construction of suffix trees in linear time.

## 🔐 Cryptography
### RSA Key Generator
Generates RSA public-private key pairs using
- Miller-Rabin Primality Testing (probabilistic prime checking)
- Euclidean Algorithm (for GCD and modular inverse)

## 🗜️ Compression
### LZ77 Encoder
Implements LZ77 compression enhanced with:
- Elias Encoding for integer representation
- Huffman Encoding for efficient binary encoding of symbols

## 📈 Optimization
### Simplex Method (Tableau Form)
Solves linear programming problems using the tableau-based implementation of the simplex algorithm.

Each algorithm is implemented as a standalone Python script. To test or run them:
```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
```
Some files may contain simple test cases or require minimal input at runtime.
